###  6. Discussion

UniVL-DR's superior performance in multi-modal retrieval underscores the success of learning a unified representation space. Challenges in handling specific image semantics were noted, pointing to areas for improvement. The modality-balanced training strategy significantly enhanced fusion across modalities. The image verbalization method successfully bridged language and vision, improving textual representations for images. UniVL-DR's promising generalization suggests potential applications in specific domains, and future research may explore additional modalities. The project opens possibilities for interactive retrieval interfaces and acknowledges limitations in domain specificity. Overall, UniVL-DR contributes significantly to multi-modal retrieval, paving the way for future advancements and user-centric interfaces.
