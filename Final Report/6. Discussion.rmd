#### **Model Performance and Challenges:**

UniVL-DR demonstrated superior performance in multi-modal retrieval, showcasing the effectiveness of learning a unified representation space. The model excelled in balancing modalities during training, mitigating modality preferences, and achieving impressive gains in both single and cross-modality tasks. However, challenges were noted in handling specific figure semantics in images, indicating potential areas for further improvement in image understanding.

#### **Impact of Modality-Balanced Training:**

The introduction of a modality-balanced hard negative training strategy played a pivotal role in enhancing UniVL-DR's capabilities. The model's ability to effectively fuse retrieval results from diverse modalities highlights the significance of addressing modality gaps in training for comprehensive multi-modal understanding.

#### **Image Verbalization Method:**

The image verbalization method, an innovative addition to UniVL-DR, successfully bridged the gap between language and vision. By paraphrasing image pixel facts into natural language, the model demonstrated improved textual representations for images. Further refinement of this method could offer deeper insights into enhancing the overall multi-modal retrieval experience.

#### **Generalization and Future Directions:**

UniVL-DR showcased promising generalization across various tasks, emphasizing the versatility of learned universal representations. Future research directions could explore the model's adaptability to specific domains and investigate its potential in handling additional modalities, such as audio and video.
