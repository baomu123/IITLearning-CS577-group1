# EVALUATION RESULTS

##  Multi-Modal Retrieval Performance

```
The UniVL-DR outperforms all baselines with more than `7%` improvement on ranking evaluation, recalls more than `6%` relevant multi-modality documents, and even outperforms the divide-and-conquer model guided by oracle modality routing.

##  Retrieval Performance of Different Ablation Models

```
UniVL-DR also shows its advantages by outperforming all baseline models on both text-text and text-image retrieval tasks, demonstrating that multi-modality modeling indeed benefits single/cross modality retrieval.

## Effectiveness of Different Hard Negative Training Strategies

```
As we see, The advantage of UniVL-DR is to build a more uniform and effective multi-modal search model through modal balanced hard negative sampling, but the disadvantage is that it may require more computing resources and training time.

## BRIDGING CROSS-MODALITY MATCHING WITH IMAGE VERBALIZATION

```
UniVL-DR successfully bridges the modal gap between text and images through image literalization methods and achieves better results in text-image and multi-modal retrieval tasks.
